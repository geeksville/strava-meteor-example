This is a little test app to experiment with ES6 and the new meteor 1.2 release.

I had also hoped to do some Strava meta-analysis but (at least for my dataset)
there were no great observations to be found.  So I've stopped with this
experiment.

If you'd like refer to this code for (somewhat crufty) example code on how to
use the Strava API from a Meteor application then this might be useful.
However, it is really rough and I can provide no support.
